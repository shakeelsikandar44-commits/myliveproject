Getting lab results can be confusing. This guide explains the most common lab tests (CBC, CMP, lipid panel, A1C, thyroid tests), shows typical reference ranges, explains how to interpret flags and trends, lists when to contact a clinician, and gives a printable action checklist. Sources include CDC/NIH/PubMed and selected works by leading physician authors.

## What a lab report usually shows
- Patient info and collection time
- Test name, result, units, and the lab’s **reference range**
- Flags such as **H** (high) or **L** (low)

> Note: Reference ranges vary by lab and population (age, sex, pregnancy). Always use the lab’s own range as the primary reference.

## Common tests and what they mean
### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- Hemoglobin: men ~13.8–17.2 g/dL; women ~12.1–15.1 g/dL
- WBC: ~4.0–11.0 ×10^3/µL
- Platelets: ~150–450 ×10^3/µL

### Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
- Glucose (fasting): ~70–99 mg/dL
- Creatinine: ~0.6–1.3 mg/dL
- ALT: ~7–56 U/L

### Lipid Panel
- Total cholesterol: desirable <200 mg/dL
- LDL: optimal <100 mg/dL (depends on risk)
- HDL: men >40 mg/dL, women >50 mg/dL

### Hemoglobin A1C
- Normal: <5.7% | Prediabetes: 5.7–6.4% | Diabetes: ≥6.5%

## How to interpret results — practical rules
1. Use the lab’s reference range.
2. Look for trends — changes over time often matter more than single numbers.
3. Consider context: fasting status, meds, recent illness, pregnancy.
4. Check for flags and follow up as recommended.

## When to contact your clinician or seek immediate care
- Seek emergency care for severe symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, severe bleeding).
- For markedly abnormal lab values or concerning symptoms, call your clinician.

## 8 Practical steps to act on lab results
1. Save and organize reports; note date/time.
2. Track trends using previous results.
3. Note whether testing required fasting or medication hold.
4. Ask your clinician to explain likely causes and next steps.
5. Prioritize lifestyle measures when indicated (diet, exercise, quit smoking).
6. Ensure medication adherence where prescribed.
7. Repeat tests when recommended.
8. Request specialist referral if needed.

## Printable checklist
- Bring past lab reports and medication list
- Note whether you fasted and time of collection
- Highlight any H or L flags on the report
- Ask: “What caused this? Should we repeat? Is medication or lifestyle change recommended?”

## FAQs
**Is a slightly out-of-range number dangerous?**
Usually not urgent, but it depends on the test and symptoms—ask your clinician.

**Why do labs have different reference ranges?**
Different instruments and populations; use your lab’s reported range.
